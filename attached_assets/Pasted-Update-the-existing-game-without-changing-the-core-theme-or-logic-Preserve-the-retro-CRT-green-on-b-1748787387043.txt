Update the existing game without changing the core theme or logic.
Preserve the retro CRT green-on-black aesthetic, but improve clarity, usability, and game feel. Do not redesign from scratch. Just refine and build on the working base.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Maintain:
	‚Ä¢	CRT-style green terminal theme
	‚Ä¢	Teller-based fraud detection mechanics
	‚Ä¢	All existing game data, logic, and visual structure

‚∏ª

üîß Improve the following:

‚∏ª

1. UI & Visual Design (App Store Ready)
	‚Ä¢	Keep CRT green theme, but increase font size, improve line spacing, and boost text contrast for mobile readability.
	‚Ä¢	Make all interactive elements large enough for touch interface (iPhone/iPad).
	‚Ä¢	When a document is clicked, open it in a large centered modal window, not just a sidebar log.
	‚Ä¢	Add step-by-step indicators at the top of the screen:
	‚Ä¢	Step 1: Review Request ‚Üí Step 2: Examine Documents ‚Üí Step 3: Verify ‚Üí Step 4: Approve/Reject

‚∏ª

2. Request Flow & Form Handling

Each service type (deposit, withdrawal, wire, inquiry) should:
	‚Ä¢	Require different forms and documents:
	‚Ä¢	Wire Transfer: Wire form, photo ID, signature, optional passport or secondary ID
	‚Ä¢	Deposit: Deposit slip, ID, signature
	‚Ä¢	Withdrawal: Withdrawal slip, ID, signature
	‚Ä¢	Account Inquiry: Just ID
	‚Ä¢	System must validate required docs and flag any missing ones before allowing progress.
	‚Ä¢	If a required document is missing, display a clear error prompt (‚ÄúMissing valid ID‚Äù).

‚∏ª

3. Document Management System
	‚Ä¢	Show all customer documents in a scrollable sidebar or grid.
	‚Ä¢	Click/tap on a doc opens large, interactive modal with zoom and highlight tools.
	‚Ä¢	Overlay should allow comparison of:
	‚Ä¢	Photo ID details (name, DOB, match with account)
	‚Ä¢	Signature
	‚Ä¢	Document validity (expiry, consistency)

‚∏ª

4. Signature Verification System
	‚Ä¢	When a signature is required, open split view:
	‚Ä¢	Left: Signature from the submitted form
	‚Ä¢	Right: Signature on file (from bank records)
	‚Ä¢	Provide:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúMATCH‚Äù / ‚ÄúFLAG MISMATCH‚Äù buttons
	‚Ä¢	Optional zoom/magnify to inspect detail
	‚Ä¢	Require manual judgment for approval (fraud detection angle)

‚∏ª

5. Sound Design (No More Arcade Beeps)

Replace current generic arcade sound with immersive ASMR-style effects:
	‚Ä¢	Typing: Light, crisp key clicks (not cartoonish)
	‚Ä¢	Document open/close: Paper shuffling, folder sounds
	‚Ä¢	Signature verification: Pen scribble or sharp ‚Äúscratch‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Approval stamp: Deep, satisfying thud
	‚Ä¢	Error/rejection: Subtle, short buzz‚Äînot jarring
	‚Ä¢	System alerts: Vintage terminal chirps or tones, short and atmospheric
Ensure sounds are varied‚Äînot one global sound‚Äîand volume-balanced and non-repetitive.

‚∏ª

6. Mobile Optimization
	‚Ä¢	Scale layout responsively for iPhone and iPad viewports.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all interactions are touch-friendly.
	‚Ä¢	Score/time bar should be readable and not squeezed.

‚∏ª

üõ† Final Rule:
Make all these changes to the existing system‚Äîdo NOT rebuild or wipe functionality.
This is a refinement pass, not a reset.
